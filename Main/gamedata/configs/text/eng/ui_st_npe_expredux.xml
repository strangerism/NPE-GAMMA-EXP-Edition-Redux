		<text>One of your limb is completely damaged, you cannot run, aim, and you might limp and walk very slow because of it

		\n
		The broken limb is shown on the BHS HUD with a %c[ui_gray_2]Grey%c[white] label (only Text BHS or Hybrid) and in the BHS doll with a completely %c[d_red]red%c[white] bar
		\n
		\n
		Such injuries can be fatal in a fight

		\n
		broken arms makes aiming with guns very hard
		\n

		while broken legs impairs your movement with limping and greatly reduced speed

		<text>You can restore the limb using medical supplies and the following procedure:
		\n
		\n
		%c[d_blue]Surgical Kit%c[white] 
		\n
		First you need to treat the wound with a surgical kit or instruments
		\n
		The UI will reflects this with the limb label turning to %c[d_purple]purple%c[white] and the bar being filled with a %c[d_blue]blue%c[white] streak  
		\n
		\n
		%c[d_blue]Splint%c[white] 
		\n
		Next, secure the limb with a splint
		\n
		The UI will reflect this with the limb indicator turning to %c[d_red]red%c[white] and the limb bar being filled with a white streak again. 
		\n
		This simply indicates that the limb can be healed again with medicines or by sleeping.
		\n
		\n
		There are other ways to restore limbs, like Surgical Instruments or a visit to the %c[d_green]doctor%c[white]

		%c[d_green]Doctors%c[white] and general %c[d_green]traders%c[white] sells medical supplies, although they might charge you considerably

		%c[d_green]Tasks%c[white] might also give such supplies as rewards.
		\n
		\n
		Eventually, if you have the resource and the right recipe, you can craft at %c[d_blue]workbenches%c[white] any medical supplies available in the game
