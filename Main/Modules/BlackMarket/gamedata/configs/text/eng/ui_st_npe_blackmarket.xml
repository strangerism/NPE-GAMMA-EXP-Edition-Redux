		<text>The merchants of the zone are dealing with the %c[d_purple]Black Market%c[white]!
		\n
		\n
		Under the counter they might sell or buy all sort of stuff, so don't be shy and ask
		\n
		\n
		Traders affiliated with the black market might have guns or other gear for sale
		\n
		\n
		Each trader has its own reputation in the black market, so not everybody's stock is the same
		\n
		\n
		Traders in the %c[d_blue]south%c[white] tend to deal with low quality gear while those %c[d_blue]deeper%c[white] in the zone have better equipment to offer
		\n
		\n
		Also affiliations must be taken in consideration for the type of guns or equipment they'll have available
		\n
		\n
		Certain factions tend to trade %c[d_blue]NATO%c[white] guns while others all they can offer is %c[d_blue]Warsaw Pact%c[white] guns

		\n
		They will gouge you so make sure you got the cream
		\n

		Selling and buying is expensive but you can arrange sweat deals if you raise the reputation with them

		\n
		Guns sold in good parts's conditions increases the money you gain from trades
