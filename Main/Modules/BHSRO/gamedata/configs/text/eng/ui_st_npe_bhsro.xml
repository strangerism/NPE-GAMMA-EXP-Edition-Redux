		The broken limb is shown on the BHS HUD with a %c[ui_gray_2]Grey%c[white] label (only Text BHS or Hybrid) and in the BHS doll with a completely %c[d_red]red%c[white] bar
		\n
		\n
		Such injuries can be fatal in a fight

		\n
		broken arms makes aiming with guns very hard

		<text>You can restore the limb using medical supplies and the following procedure:
		\n

		%c[d_blue]Surgical Kit%c[white]

		First you need to treat the wound with a surgical kit or instruments
		\n
		The UI will reflects this with the limb label turning to %c[d_purple]purple%c[white] and the bar being filled with a %c[d_blue]blue%c[white] streak  
		\n

		%c[d_blue]Splint%c[white]

		Next, secure the limb with a splint
		\n
		The UI will reflect this with the limb indicator turning to %c[d_red]red%c[white] and the limb bar being filled with a white streak again. 
		\n
		This simply indicates that the limb can be healed again with medicines or by sleeping.
